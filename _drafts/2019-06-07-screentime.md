For quite some time, I’ve struggled to explain the rationale behind what appears to be the most glaringly hypocritical aspect of my life: I’m the CEO of a tech company that makes [an app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readup-app/id1441825432), and yet I refuse to use a smartphone. I have a flip phone. Most peoples’ eyes glaze over when I try to clarify that, first of all, Readup isn’t just an app. It’s a platform. And since I tend to be long-winded anyway, it’s an approach that’s never going to work. I need a new angle. 

**Thankfully, we just launched Stats, an exciting new feature that we’ve been planning for over a year.** And in the funny way that startups are full of surprises, it just occurred to me, quite unexpectedly, that the best way to tell you about Stats, how it came to be and why we think it’s a big deal, might also be an opportunity to put this whole flip phone issue to bed once and for all. 

But first, I need to rewind. 

September 2011. I’m twenty-four. My undergrad days at Stanford feel like ancient history even though I’m barely a year out and never even graduated. I’ll sort that out later. For now, I’m living the Silicon Valley dream: solid job, apartment in Pac Heights with sweeping views of the Golden Gate and Alcatraz, the whole nine yards. But something isn’t right and that something seems to be emanating from my phone. So I do what a lot of people do when they need to figure things out; I enroll in a yoga teacher training course. For ten weekends in a row, I’m in yoga mode from Friday afternoon to Sunday night. To kick it up a notch, I leave my phone at the office and sleep the nights under the stars in the Berkeley foothills, a charade inspired by a book I just finished, _Dharma Bums_ by Jack Kerouac. In hindsight, I can see that I was pioneering something that would soon become a widespread cultural phenomenon: the digital detox. 

Fast forward. January 2018. On a cold winter night in New Hampshire, Jeff and I are in the woods with shovels and flashlights. We’re stomping through a foot of snow and ice, trying to figure out where I buried my iPhone the previous fall. The following morning, we’re set to kick off an iOS project with a team of eight Dartmouth undergraduates. Needless to say, it won’t look good if I don’t have a device. The technical aspects of this project are complicated enough, I can’t imagine how confused these students will be if I try to explain how the flip phone fits in with the larger vision: _We’re building an entirely new medium. A better way to use the internet. Time well spent. Screen time that’s good for you! Reading!_ Besides, at this point, that vision is still blurry even to me. What I know is that I hate my iPhone. I like having it underground. And, sure enough, we can’t find it anyway. After digging a few holes, we give up and call it a night.

So, why am I telling you all of this? 

For one thing, I want to convince you that I’ve been thinking about this topic  — healthy tech, “humane” tech, what we talk about when we talk about screen time — for my entire career, my entire adult life. 

Fast forward again, to today, to right now. I’m typing on an Alphasmart NEO, disconnected from everything and everyone, in the middle of the woods in Manistee National Forest in northern Michigan. Unlike almost everyone other human I know, I'm disconnected, except when I'm not. Instead of the other way around. When I pop online, usually at public libraries, I send emails and read. As a CEO, I also face a smattering of random to-dos on a daily basis, but I’ve learned that almost everything can wait a day, and it’s nice to take time to think about things. Let stuff marinate. And sometimes, let stuff go. Slow and focused — what Cal Newport (who doesn’t use social media) calls “deep work” — is actually easier, saner, and way more enjoyable. Go figure, the tortoise and hare story is worth taking seriously.

What I'm describing is a movement. And it's growing. And leadership is emerging. In addition to Newport, there’s Tristan Harris (who became the de-facto face of “humane" tech after a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_the_manipulative_tricks_tech_companies_use_to_capture_your_attention) that turned him into a bonafide celebrity), Maryanne Wolf, Jaron Lanier, Sherry Turkle, Jenny Odell, Shoshana Zuboff, Catherine Price, and many, many more, including the godfather, Nicholas Carr, whose book _The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains_ remains the magnum opus, the book that set the conversation in motion back in 2010.

Amongst this group of thinkers, there is unanimous agreement: “screen time = bad” might be a starting point, _but it’s definitely not the final answer._ I put myself on the far radical end of the spectrum (opposite Harris, who seems unable to avoid getting dangerously cozy with the social media giants) and even I agree. We can’t reject screens altogether. We need to reimagine the way they fit into our lives. And, frankly, we need them to get better. A lot better.

I use the Readup app on an old iPad that I hacked to be a Readup-only device. When turned on, it loads the Readup app, and it can’t do anything else. I can't even quit the app. I use it to read. And that’s it. And it’s amazing. It’s a prototype Readup eReader, perfect for 100% distraction-free reading. It’s a screen that I love and the more time I spend with it, the better I feel. It doesn't compete with other apps. It competes with walking around in the woods. With ice cream at sunset. Above all else, it competes with books. And sometimes, but not always, it wins. 

This brings me to Stats. When I look at it, I don’t see stuff I wish I wasn’t doing. I see something I’m proud of. I see positivity. This is due to the fundamental goodness of reading, what it has in common with running, eating vegetables, studying, and, dare I say, love. What makes the Stats graph so groundbreaking is that it’s a visual manifestation of that positivity, that goodness. I makes me think of words like “strive,” and “achieve" and "life force." It makes me happy. 

Having said all of that, I have mixed feelings about the “quantified-self” movement. As a runner, I turned a corner when I stopped timing myself and tracking distances. Now I just run. And, ironically, I think I’m going faster and farther than ever before. One user recently told me: “I'm a bit put off by the 'gamification' of reading - the earning of points and stuff for articles.” I _really_ feel that. Yet another user, completely unprompted, wrote me this: "I would love to know what my overall read time is. gosh, if i could only replace 10 or 20% of my phone screen time with actually reading time I feel like I'd be well on my way to genius status. or at least bliss." My jaw almost hit the floor when I read that, because it came in just moments before Stats officially shipped. We considered these tradeoffs, the pros and cons, and ultimately, the decision to allow users to see their own Stats was a no-brainer. Different aspects of Readup will motivate different types of people. There's no right or wrong. But in general, getting people to read things on the internet is like pushing a boulder up a hill, so we _need_ to use every tool at our disposal.

When I look at my own Stats graph, I see our entire mission in a nutshell. The launch of Stats has been an opportunity for me to reflect not only on my own personal goals as a reader, but also on my goals as an entrepreneur, and on Readup's goals as a business. Here's yet another way that the Stats graph surprised me: It's a huge step forward in terms of organizational transparency. Our goal, as a company, is perfectly in line with your goals, as a user. More reading. More focus. More of that _magic_ that can only happen when your attention isn't scattered all over the place. 

This isn’t true elsewhere. Facebook doesn’t show stats because it would horrify most people. Twitter and Reddit are, generally speaking, a bit more forthright. Hence the corporate vibes that sometimes feel downright brutal. They show you aspects of your "performance" (likes, followers, karma, whatever) which forces the question: Why chase that stuff? Regardless, as far as I know, there’s no platform -- except Readup! -- that shows _usage time_ as a top level metric, a thing you should chase, as clearly and honestly as Readup. 

This is possible because Readup equals reading. Which equals time well spent. Period. 

We still have some mountains to climb. Financial sustainability is the biggest and most obvious one. But since we know our true north (true reading, _really_ reading) a lot of the ethical questions have simple answers. For example, we don’t want you spending too much time on the Discover page, selecting an article to read. The purpose of the list on that page is _to get you off that page_, to get you reading, as quickly as possible.

To buy into all of this, you only need to buy into one simple concept: That reading is inherently good. Yesterday, at the Pathfinder Library in Baldwin, Michigan, I saw a little old lady fill an entire bag with books. Specifically, a brand of cheap, pseudo-steamy romance novels about “Faith, Love, and Hope” with titles like “The Amish Widow’s Rescue” and “My One And Only Duke.” The librarians confirmed to me that it’s hard for them to sate her voracious reading appetite. For a few seconds, I wondered: Is that even good? It is healthy? And the answer, I think, is clear: Yes. Reading, no matter what you’re reading, or when or why, is always a good thing. There’s no such thing as “waste of time” reading, “destructive” reading, “reading addiction.” Reading - always - is good. End of story.

David Carr, in The Shallows, hits the nail on the head: 

>> The form that writing came to take on a page of parchment or paper enabled us to become deep readers, to turn our attention, and our brain power, to the interpretation of meaning. With writing on the screen, we’re still able to decode text quickly — we read, if anything, faster than ever — but we’re no longer guided toward a deep, personally constructed understanding of the text’s connotations. Instead, we’re hurried off toward another bit of related information, and then another, and another. The strip-mining of “relevant content” replaces the slow excavation of meaning.

That’s one of several passages that I surrounded with stars and exclamation points and even a little hand-drawn brain. It still shocks me that his primary target was Google, not social media, and that those words were written long before Facebook and Twitter became dominant forces in society. A decade later, that reads like a premonition. 

**The solution has never _not_ been reading. Now, for the first time ever, the solution is measurable.** 

Eighty years from now, we’ll look back on one hundred years of screen time. What a fantastical thing to consider, that we're reading and writing that story as we speak. 

**What say you? About Stats. About screen time. About anything and everything. Your feedback is our future.**
