Dear reader,
</p>
<p>
We just shipped a bunch of updates that killed "My Feed" for good, simplified the overall site navigation, and centralized all notifications under the bell icon.
</p>
<p>All of this to clear the way for Discover, a new way to explore articles and stories on Readup. 
</p>
<p><strong>Readup is now a full-on digital newspaper.</strong> Plus magazine. It's everything, basically. For the first time ever, Readup puts a lifetime's worth of reading available at your fingertips, and you can browse it by Publication, Topic or Writer. It's all super high-quality and it's all crowd-sourced and crowd-ranked by you, our community of readers. 
</p>

Here's how we think about this: If you're going to take the time to read, you should read mind-blowingly good stuff. <strong>Article selection matters.</strong> Readers have been asking for this for ages, but we haven't had the data to support the idea. Now we do. 
</p>
<p>
As always, articles (and now also Publications, Topics and Writers) are ranked by the total amount of time that real humans spend reading articles <em>to completion</em>. So, because the New York Times and Haruki Murakami are the top ranked publication and writer on Readup -- meaning, the most deeply read -- they appear at the top of those respective lists. 
    </p>
    <p>
These lists will churn, slowly, according to the reading behavior of the community. Things should always feel fresh without feeling erratic. (If the feed is a waterfall of noise, we're trying to build, say, a bubbling brook of wisdom.) On Readup, slow is a feature. Articles, like great ideas and happy memories, need time to marinate - both on an individual and collective level.
        </p>
        <p>
Don't stop reading. As ever, the future depends on it!

                        PS I miss the days when I wasn't the one setting the curve, but I'd like to give a special shoutout to Readup's #1 Scout <a href="https://readup.com/@deephdave">deephdave</a>, who is personally responsible for nine of the last thirty AOTD winners. If you're not already following him, you should be.
