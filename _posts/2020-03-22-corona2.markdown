Dear reader, 
</p>

<p>
By definition, news is nothing without “newness.” Speed is baked into the equation. 

<p>
You already know that. And you also know that it’s been that way forever. Yellow journalism. Propaganda. <em>If it bleeds it leads.</em>
</p>

<p>
But have you ever wondered, practically speaking, how to actually slow it down? Here at Readup, it’s something we think about constantly.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slow is in the Readup DNA.</strong> 
</p>

<p>
The platform <em>literally</em> slows you down. I have seen it happen. I have seen the way that people use social media with frantic fingers and twitchy eyes. And I have seen the way that people transition from that to reading on Readup. They settle in. They curl up, just as they would with a book or a kitten. It’s a beautiful thing -- beautiful because it’s slow. (And because I just said kitten.) 
</p>

<p>
We focus all of our time on that magical interaction between you, reader, and whatever you’re reading on Readup. Specifically, in that moment, we’re trying to disappear.
</p>

<p>
And because that interaction (reading!) is a slow one, the whole network is slower. It moves at a conversational pace. Information has to marinate with several people before it starts creeping up the list, exposing it to more readers. We’re killing fake news by killing the knee-jerk reaction. 
</p>

<p>
Good stories take time to write. And good writing takes time to read. “Hot takes” don’t do well on Readup for the simple reason that they’re often not read-worthy. Meanwhile, the Readup community seems to have a knack for sniffing up older content, classics worth reading again now.
</p>

<p>
Coronavirus is all over Readup. That was inevitable; it changed life all over the planet. But we need time to process. We need time to think. And thankfully, that’s exactly what Readup provides.
</p>

<p>
Have a great week, 
</p>

<p>
Bill
