Nothing makes us happier than hearing from members of our community about the positive experiences they’re having on Readup. 

Recently, one of our top users, Tripleg, broke into a TRIPLE digit reading streak! Yes, you read that correctly — he’s read a full article per day every single day for over one hundred days in a row. What an achievement! 

And it looks like he’s not stopping any time soon! As of today, he’s at 110 days.

To celebrate Tripleg’s epic read streak, we created a limited edition “100-DAY STREAK WINNER” T-shirt and we’re beyond thrilled to find out that he’s actually been wearing it. Check this out:

Keep it up, Tripleg! We’ll send you another shirt when you hit 1,000! :P
