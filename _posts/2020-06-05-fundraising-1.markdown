Now that we have achieved product-market fit, Readup is raising one million dollars to grow our team and accelerate our growth.

Product-market fit is [garbage language] for Do you have something that's really important? Something that people really want, something that will solve a problem for them and make their life better. 

We have that.

I've been doing this for long enough to (finally) understand that there's no way I can show you any numbers to convince you of this fact. If that sounds counter-intuitive, hear me out: Numbers and data will certainly be _part_ of the story, but what actually matters is the experience that people are having on Readup, and not just *that* we are growing, but *how* we are growing. The story is the truth. The numbers are just facts.

To illustrate what I mean, imagine that I'm a conniving and dishonest entrepreneur. Imagine that I bought myself a little corner of the internet and I 

Readup has zero costs. Readup has spent zero dollars on marketing. 

Let  could set up a little corner of the internet, and pay to have a few hundred people 

May was the biggest month in Readup's history. By far. Pick a metric and it was up. Way up.

June's going to be bigger. Way bigger. 

I'm learning how to say things like that, but it's not my style at all. Jeff, my co-founder, is pretty much the same way. And since it's just the two of us, Readup itself (both the company and the product) has taken on that vibe. We prefer to put our heads down and work. The fact that Readup exists means that it's telling its own story every day. It's not bigger or smaller than me, Jeff, or the entire community, but it's just different. Readup is alive. 

And now I'm being called upon to tell the story. Because Readup is fundraising. 



I've been thinking a lot about the difference between needing something and wanting something, and I think the difference might be merely a mindset. Regardless, Readup, meaning me and Jeff,  Overall, it's an honor and privelege. I completely love my job. I love what we built, I love what it does to me, my brain, and the brains of my closest loved ones, and I love the fact that thousands of others are now tapping into it on a daily basis.  

Thanks to a generous plug from our new friend Kai over at [Dense Discovery], the size of our community essentially doubled over night.

This is how it's been from the very beginning. We have grown entirely by word of mouth, starting with our significant others, siblings and parents, then, slowly, everybody we know (over the course of three years) and, eventually, people started telling more people, so now Jeff and I don't need to tell people about it anymore, because people take care of that part of the equation for us. 

We're still *insanely* busy though. I'm swimming in support tickets, chucking bugs and urgent feature requests from our power-readers over to Jeff, who's somehow finding time to slice and dice new views on our insanely powerful reading data set so that I can go pitch it to investors.

All of this live. We're doing it live. 








On the one hand, I'm a bit to embarrassed to admit the swiftness with which that fact became clear to me. It's not something that I figured out without a bunch of help. My co-founder bludgened the fact into me over the course of March and April. 

We've been working on this thing for three years now, almost entirely just the two of us, although we have worked with a number of amazing people all along the way.

The upside of working at Readup is that you get to be your own boss, you work however you want, whenever you want, wherever you want. 

The downside of working at Readup is that you don't make any money. In fact, it *costs* money to work at Readup. That's why it's only been the two co-founders, who live frugally and work constantly on Readup. 

It's time to change that. We need to start paying ourselves and, more importantly, the company is rapidly growing. 

May was our biggest month on record, by far, across every single metric in the business. Period. I don't even need to look at the metrics to tell you that, because I don't have time to, but ask me to show you something and I'll show you. 

The downside of running Readup is that you don't make any money while you're doing it. Jeff and I are crazy obsessed with the thing, so we've been digging into savings, 

The hardest thing about running Readup right now is thinking, often, about all of the people who have come to love Readup as much as my co-founder and I love Readup. It chokes me up, daily, but I'm emotional AF so take that with a grain of salt. 

The last months have been absurd. In the coming weeks, I'll tell you more (a lot more, hopefully) about why I have been silent for a month, immediately after being really loud for a few weeks, all of which is wrapped up in a much larger narrative about my life and why I think it matters, and, specifically, how I'm trying to matter. That's what this is all about: the purpose of my work is the purpose of my life. 

I need some time to get warmed up though. I need to finish laughing at myself for making yet another commitment about how I'm going to write every day. Wait for it. Wait for it...

The Readup blog is now going to be a daily: Readup fundraising updates.
