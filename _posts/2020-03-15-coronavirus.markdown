Dear reader,
</p>

<p>
Jeff and I have been working hard on our Y Combinator application, which is due tomorrow night. It's hard to overstate how big of a deal it would be if we get accepted. We've been declined twice already. In fact, we haven't even managed to get an interview so far!

P.S. Some excellent further reading about Y Combinator. This <a href="https://readup.com/read/the-new-yorker/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">evergreen profile</a> on Sam Altman, former president of YC, pretty much says it all.
