Dear reader,
</p>

<p>
Jeff and I have been working hard on our Y Combinator application, which is due tomorrow night. It's hard to overstate how big of a deal it would be if we get accepted. We're hoping that third time's a charm. Cross your fingers for us!
</p>

<p>
Y Combinator is looking for startups that are just on the verge of growing like crazy. Conveniently, yet again, we just had our best day and best week ever.

We can trace a lot of our growth to <a href="https://readup.com/comments/organizer-sandbox/coronavirus-why-you-must-act-now">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://readup.com/comments/organizer-sandbox/coronavirus-why-you-must-act-now">my newsletter</a>, and a few other sources, but we also think that the coronavirus has given us a bump. During times of crisis (both real and imagined) people feel an increased need to seek out high-quality, reliable information. In general, a good rule of thumb is this: <em>go to where the readers are.</em>

Here are the coronavirus stories that won AOTD on Readup. Ya'll know I love drinking my own Kool-Aid, but I still want to say this: I genuinely believe that this is the best coronavirus reading list you'll find anywhere. After all, these are the articles that people are <em>actually, really</em> reading:

If you want to know what's going on, you have to work (read) for it!

P.S. If you want to read more about Y Combinator, I seriously loved <a href="https://readup.com/read/the-new-yorker/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">"Sam Altman's Manifest Destiny,"</a> a profile from The New Yorker on former YC president Sam Altman. It's a few years old and aging very well! :)
