2021 was a great year on Readup and we’re pleased to announce the fifteen articles that got the most reads, the highest ratings, and the most vigorous commenting activity.

As we did [last year](https://blog.readup.com/2021/01/11/the-best-digital-reading-of-2020-brought-to-you-by-readup.html), we broke the list into three sections based on article length: **Short** (less than 10 mins), **Medium** (between 10 and 30 mins) and **Long** (more than 30 mins).

Major thanks to all the readers who *scouted* (that is, found & posted) these excellent reads. Your service to the community can’t be measured in words or read counts. 

Enjoy!

Jump to [Short](#short-9-mins-or-less) - [Medium](#medium-10-30-mins) - [Long](#long-30-mins-or-more)

## Short (9 mins or less)

You could finish reading these in the time it takes to get a cup of coffee!

Netflix released the acclaimed TV series *Maid* in 2021, but in 2015 the main subject of these episodes already wrote an article airing out the gory details of her work. Want to be a voyeur for a few minutes?

> The Netflix show is on now, and I just watched the first excellent episode. But you know what's even better than that first episode? This piece. - [@sjwoo](https://readup.com/@sjwoo)

### [Omicron Is the Beginning of the End](https://readup.com/read/the-atlantic/omicron-is-the-beginning-of-the-end)

6 mins — By [Yascha Mounk](https://readup.com/writers/yascha-mounk) in The Atlantic — [comments](https://readup.com/comments/the-atlantic/omicron-is-the-beginning-of-the-end)

Writer Yascha documents an unwillingness to respond to COVID-19 waves with the same intensity as we did early early in the pandemic.

## Medium (10-30 mins)

These reads take a bit more commitment, but are a bit more rewarding too.

### [I Am a Heroin User. I Do Not Have a Drug Problem](https://nautil.us/i-am-a-heroin-user-i-do-not-have-a-drug-problem-9590/)[*](#footnote)

14 mins — By Mark Macnamara in Nautilus — [comments](https://readup.com/comments/nautilus/i-am-a-heroin-user-i-do-not-have-a-drug-problem)

An article doesn’t have please everyone to be valuable. What’s important to us is that it invites civil discourse and free thinking. Drugs are definitely a politically and culturally sensitive topic, and this article offered a contrarian opinion. I’m proud of the way the Readup community handled this one. Read the thesis, then read the reactions to learn more!

### [How Giving Up Refined Sugar Changed My Brain](https://readup.com/read/pocket/how-giving-up-refined-sugar-changed-my-brain)

12 mins — By [Michael Grothaus](https://readup.com/writers/michael-grothaus) in Fast Company — [comments](https://readup.com/comments/pocket/how-giving-up-refined-sugar-changed-my-brain)

According to the comments, this article could change lives for the better! Worth a read if you’re battling with sugar or interested in the topic.

Possibly the most entertaining read of the year?

> I actually didn't even want to read this, but once I started I couldn't stop. Which is surely why it won AOTD. Just too juicy to resist. — [@bill](https://readup.com/@bill)

I’ll let [@bartadamley](https://readup.com/@bartadamley) say it:

> Such an informative piece on what cryptocurrencies are. Highly recommend this piece, as it seems we are at the very beginning of the blockchain being implemented on a "mainstream" level.

Most of these reads take you on a deep, personal journey. Live another’s life for an hour.

In a decades-long project, Gay tells the story of Gerald Foos, who bought a motel in order to watch his guests having sex. A story that eventually entangles the writer himself too.

> This is a remarkable story, and heartbreaking in it's own way. I tend to be drawn to stories that show the machinations of the internet at work, especially the dark side, and this one is a beautifully written and engaging story of how it ate this woman up for daring to publish her art. — [@Alexa](https://readup.com/@Alexa)
> 

> Wow, this is incredibly nuanced reporting. — [@Jessica](https://readup.com/@Jessica)

41 mins — By Tony Tulathimutte in n+1  — [comments](https://readup.com/comments/n-1/the-feminist)

> His friends, mostly female, told him he was refreshingly attentive and trustworthy for a boy. Meanwhile he is grateful for the knowledge that female was best used as an adjective, that sexism harms men too (though not nearly to the extent that it harms women), and that certain men pretend to be feminists just to get laid. — n+1

> Highly recommended even though reading this might ruin your day. Really exceptional writing. - [@jeff](https://readup.com/@jeff)
