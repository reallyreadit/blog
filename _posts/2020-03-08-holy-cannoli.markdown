Dear reader,
</p>

<p>
In the last few weeks, Jeff and I have been ramping up our efforts to interact <em>directly</em> with readers. So we're beyond thrilled about the hundreds of emails and comments pouring in. 
</p>

<p>
It sometimes takes a little while to reply, but I want to make sure you all know this: <strong>We are reading <em>every single word</em> of feedback!</strong> In fact, every word gets read <em>twice</em>: once by Jeff and once by me. And then, after we have both read everything, we review it all together. 
</p>

<p>
Also, it doesn't matter if you hit me up by email, reply to a survey, or just say something about Readup in the comments. We're capturing everything. 
</p>

<p>
All of the feedback has inspired a huge shift in mindset. We no longer ask ourselves: <em>"What should we build?"</em> Instead, we ask ourselves: <em>"What is the community telling us to build?"</em>  
</p>

<p>
Along those lines, we heard one very specific thing, loud and clear: <strong> OMG. We need an Android app!! </strong> Okay! We'll need a few weeks, but we're on it. Seriously. And, in the meantime, Jeff is knees-deep overhauling the desktop browser extension so that we can launch new extensions for Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Brave, and Edge.
</p>

<p>
The numbers still look great. These days, we're focused on the <em>daily</em> number of <em>Weekly</em> Active Users. (Bizarre, right? Happy to further explain if folks are interested.)
</p>

Up. That's what matters. Up up up.
