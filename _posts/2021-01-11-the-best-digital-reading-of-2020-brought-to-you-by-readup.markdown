[Readup](https://readup.com/) is the world's first [digital reading marketplace](https://blog.readup.com/2020/01/12/long-live-the-attention-economy.html), currently in open beta. We are pioneering a [deeper and more meaningful way](https://blog.readup.com/2020/03/22/corona2.html) for readers and writers to connect online.

Uniquely, Readup sources top-quality reading material without any individual human interference. Curation is fully decentralized across the entire community of Readers. 

Every time a Reader [finishes an article](https://blog.readup.com/2020/11/02/how-readup-knows-whether-or-not-youve-read-an-article.html), it gets boosted in the universal algorithm. On a daily basis, articles compete for the coveted AOTD (Article of the Day) trophy and once a year we announce the *ultimate* winners, the Articles of the Year.

As we did [last year](https://blog.readup.com/2019/12/29/readups-top-reads-of-2019.html), we broke the list into three sections (based on length, shown as estimated reading time) and cut it off after the top 5 in each category. Without further ado, the winners:
