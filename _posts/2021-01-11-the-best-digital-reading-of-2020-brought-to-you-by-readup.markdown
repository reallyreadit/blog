[Readup](https://readup.com/) is the world's first digital reading marketplace, currently in open beta. We are pioneering a deeper and more meaningful way for readers and writers to connect online. 

Uniquely, Readup sources top-quality reading material without any individual human interference. Curation is fully decentralized across the entire community of Readers. 

Every time a reader finishes an article, it gets boosted in the universal algorithm. On a daily basis, articles compete for the coveted AOTD (Article of the Day) trophy and once a year we announce the *ultimate* winners -- the Articles of the Year, or AOTYs. 

As we did [last year](https://blog.readup.com/2019/12/29/readups-top-reads-of-2019.html), we broke the list into three sections (based on length, shown as estimated reading time) and cut it off after the top 5 in each category. Without further ado, the winners:
