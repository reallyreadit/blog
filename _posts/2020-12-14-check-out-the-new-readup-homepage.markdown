Over the course of the last few weeks, we've been working on a completely new design for the Readup homepage to coincide with the launch of the paid version of Readup. 

This is your chance to weigh in. 

Remember that we're building all of this stuff *and* figuring out how to market it at the same time. So the feedback that you share right now will have a major impact on the future of Readup. 

You can reply in the comments or send emails to support@readup.com

Can't wait to hear what you think! -Bill
