<b>Do I need to download the extension?</b><br>
Yes. For now, that's the only way you can get credit for fully reading things.

<b>What is the Hot Topics page?</b><br>
Hot Topics are articles that people are commenting on, sorted in reverse chronological order.

<b>Can I "submit" an article to the Hot Topics page?</b><br>
Totally. Just comment on anything, anywhere, and it will shoot to the top of the page.

<b>What is the Reading List?</b><br>
Your Reading List is private, nobody else can see it. Star articles to add them to your Reading List.

<b>How do you prevent people from cheating?</b><br>
Our software is sophisticated. It won't give you credit for skipping or skimming. 

<b>Can I use my phone?</b><br>
Yes and no. You have to use Chrome on Mac or PC to get credit for really reading. However, once you get credit, you can comment from any device, including mobile.


<b>What does "beta" mean?</b><br>
It means that this is a big experiment and we want your feedback. Click [here](http://blog.reallyread.it/jekyll/update/2017/07/06/beta-testers.html) for more info.  

<b>What's the reallyread.it business plan? How are you going to make money?</b><br>
To keep our product free for our community, we license our technology (an easy-to-install embed) to publishers who want to clean up their comments sections and improve reader engagement. 

<b>What if I have another question?</b><br>
