# **What is reallyread.it?**
A reading platform that helps you read *better* and read *more*. It's powered by a small community of readers and thinkers. Join us! We read and talk about the world's best articles. reallyread.it is social media that's good for you.

# **Where do the articles come from?**
All content is crowdsourced. Our algorithm uses reading data provided by our community of readers, aggregated and annonymized. Reads and comments cause articles to rise up the list. And longer articles get an extra boost. 

# **Can I read any articles I want?**
On Mac and PC, yes. On iPhone or iPad, soon! (In the meantime, there's a workaround: Star anything you want from desktop and you can read it on your phone.)  

# **Does reading matter?**
Yes. Deep, focused, undistracted reading grows the brain and feeds the soul. It makes you smarter and more informed about what's going on in the world. And it makes you happier and healthier.

# **Will my reading improve?**
Yes. Reading is an exercise, like running or lifting weights. You'll see improvement right away, and the more you do it the better you'll get.

# **Does reallyread.it make money?**
Not yet. Everything is free for now. In 2019, we'll introduce the first paid features and products.
