## **What is reallyread.it?**
We are a community. A group of people who love reading and critical thinking. Every day we read the best articles and stories from the world's top publications and independent writers. The platform (also called reallyread.it) is our hub. It's a radically new kind of social media network, one that's actually *good* for you.

## **What is “real” reading?** 
There's nothing inherently wrong with bouncing around on the internet, but it's not *really* reading. Deep reading happens when you stick with one text for an extended period of time. You've really read something if you've read *the whole thing* from beginning to end. This is how writers intend for their writing to be read. All the way through. 

## **How can I become a better reader?** 
Read. As much as possible. Reading is a lot like exercise; the more you do it the better you'll get. After using reallyread.it for a few months, you'll find yourself plowing through longer and smarter articles. 

## **How do I win?** 
On reallyread.it, everybody wins. But if you're feeling extra competitive, try getting on one of the leadersboards! 

## **Can I "like" or "upvote" things?**
Nope. Liking is the Achilles' heel of social media. It's the lifeblood of most platforms and the main driver of clickbait. 

On reallyread.it, articles bubble up if they're being widely read by our community. Here's another way to think about it: read are sort of like an anonymous upvotes.

## **Who are the moderators?**  
Nobody. reallyread.it has no moderators. Conversations stay civil and on-topic because the platform enforces one universal rule: nobody can comment on articles they haven't really read. 

## **Who curates the articles on the Home page?**
Nobody. To avoid human bias, everything is crowdsourced. Our algorithm is powered by reading data created by the community. If something is getting lots of reads, it’s probably worth reading. Nobody reads clickbait, which is why it doesn’t exist here. 

## **How does reallyread.it make money?** 
It doesn’t. Yet. In 2019, we’ll begin experimenting with a few different business models.

## **I want to get involved. How can I help?** 
Two things: (1) Use the platform as much as possible and send us your feedback. (2) Spread the word! Tell everyone you know about reallyread.it!









Deep reading makes you smarter, healthier and happier. It's exercise for your brain. And the more you do it the better you get. 

Shallow browsing, aka skimming and scanning, isn't the same thing as reading. It doesn't activate your brain circuitry in the same way. Unlike reading, it's draining and depressing.
