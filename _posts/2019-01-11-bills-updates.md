What even *is* social media? 

When Earthlings 'do' social media, what are they actually doing? (Hint: not reading.) 

And what, in turn, is social media doing to us, as individuals and as a society? 

No shortage of “experts” have weighed in on these questions and the world’s largest and most reputable news organizations seem [downright] [obsessed] [with] [the] [topic]. This isn't a huge surprise; these same orgnizations have the most to lose in a world where 'media’ and ‘news’ have come to mean ‘anybody anywhere saying anything.' But the questions remain unanswered. 

Social media : candy :: reading : vegetables. 

It's a great - and strange! - time to be building a social media platform. 

'Great' because basically everyone everywhere now knows that Facebook, Twitter and Reddit are junk.

But also 'strange' because user experiences, across the board, are so outrageously low. The concept of *constructive* conversation sounds impossibly idealistic. Wasting countless hours wading through an endless stream of bad content, on our feeds and in our inboxes, seems like an unavoidable reality that we should just get used to. But we shouldnt...

# Imagine that an alien from outer space is watching a human use Facebook. 

There's a good chance the alien would think that the human is playing a relatively boring video game. The ‘video’ part is interactive and involves a lot of rapid scrolling through information - the News Feed. The ‘game’ is the liking and sharing, the earning of points.

The alien would notice that the game, strangely, has no end. There's no definitive way to win. Players take detours from the game (to buy stuff) but mostly they just skim around, glancing briefly at headlines, liking, sharing, and occasionally commenting. 

Headlines are a *major* part of the game. Reading - real reading - is not. This is because nobody makes money when people *actually* read stuff online. As a result, the average amount of time spent on an article on the internet is about two seconds. 

Clickbait isn't an evil plot. It’s a natural adaptation, a survival response from publishers, an attempt to meet readers *where they are*. Or, in other words, *where they aren’t reading*. 

The alien wonders: What's the point of this game? And how did this game come to engulf the entire journalism industry? 

Twitter, the alien notices, is the same game, a nearly-identical machine but for a few distinguishing characteristics: even shorter nuggets of text, an emphasis on racking up followers, and even more unreality - lots of accounts aren’t even human, they are bots.

The biggest innovation from Facebook isn’t technological, it’s ideological: it’s that *we think the game is real* because it’s populated by all kinds of pseudo-real stuff, updates from people and things you recognize from the real world. 

Everyone plays. Family, friends, strangers and world leaders; liking and sharing, making comments and replies, fighting trolls and echo-chambers, skimming and scanning mindlessly around the web. Doing all kinds of things except reading because that's just not part of the equation. Until now. 

# The solution is reallyread.it

reallyread.it is a social media platform built *for* readers, *by* readers, and *powered by reading*.

We quit our jobs and built it from scratch. [Our story, with pictures.]

reallyread.it is a free speech zone and a safe space of sorts; everyone who participates has to comply with the same widely enforced rule -- you can't leave comments on any articles you haven't fully read. The best part is that “the rule” isn't enforced by people. (No moderators!) Rather, it is enforced by a piece of technology that we have built which is able to identify when a person is or isn’t reading. 

Our technology is simple, but powerful. Using a chrome extension, users get credit for stuff they’ve read fully, which unlocks commenting privileges. It’s not possible to comment on anything you haven’t fully read.

On both sides of the aisle, people feel misunderstood and unable to understand. When anchored in a shared experience, like really reading the same article, for example, people find it easier to see new perspectives and share meaningful, personal insights.

We're proud that reallyread.it is a Feed-free(TM) internet site.  

It is morally reprehensible. A phenomenon of our time that future historians will recognize as one of the more shameful human accomplishments, along with global warming,  Every major social media business makes money in the same way, through a simple feature at the center of the platform: a never-ending scroll where 

Future historians will not look back fondly on 'the feed,' the technology phenomenon that currently dominates the internet, a core feature of almost every major social media platform around the world: a game of liking, served up in an endless scroll. Bite-sized pieces of information, 

Why I read.

Reading is everything. I'm sitting in the Island Heights Library reflecting on that fact. I have been coming here since I was 5 years old. It's exactly one block away from the house I grew up in. 

Taking pictures inside a library is some amateur shit, so let me try to explain, in words, where I am and what I am talking about. I'm on a sturdy wooden chair at a sturdy wooden table. I'm staring at a wall of Danielle Steel novels. To my left, a flimsier fold-out table is piled high with broschures and handouts, various public service type things, in various languages, lots of government insignia, lots of red.  

Reading connects me to the world. 

If I could learn how to slow down, it would greatly improve my life. I'm restless, always. And easily distractible. On the move. 

I'm telling you this because I think it has something to do with the reason I deleted all of my social media accounts. I think that if we look it in the eye, we can eliminate most suffering. And I think that all of these things, in turn, have something to do with the reason that I keep working on reallyread.it. So let me see if I can break all of that apart. 

For years, social media capitalized on my weaker sensibilities - the desire for quick, silly hits. Nothing cerebral, nothing complex. Everything superficial, shallow. Facebook isn't where you go to be creatively inspired, it's where you go to turn everything off. To shut down. To just sit there and surveil for a little while. 

From one alien to another, in outer space: Humans, sitting before boxes, looking at fake worlds, instead of going out and living in the real one. 
 
to make the world fake and then look at it for a little while. Not soon enough, I realized that I wasn't getting enough value in exchange for how much was being extracted from me. So that's why I quit: The juice wasn't worth the squeeze. 

I was an English major, which is a crazy way to spend four years. Some of the classes were "seminar"-style, meaning they involved a small group of students, usually less than ten, around a table with a member of the faculty. Homework for literature classes often involved hundreds of pages of reading and professors weren't shy about cold-calling. On a weekly basis, it was often a guarantee that you'd be asked to pipe up about Chaucer, Dickens, and a room full of friends and enemies who were ready to pipe up if you mixed up the Bronte sisters or - god forbid! - just straight up don't understand anything by Faulkner.

Soon after my first year at Stanford, Apple released the iPhone and practically overnight everyone had one. It was possible to distract yourself with email or Facebook during classtime, especially in larger lectures where everyone hid behind Macbooks, but in small group discussions it was out of the question. The conversations were too intellectually demanding. And although the stakes were virtually non-existant (everyone got solid grades and was entitled to unlimited hand-holding whenever necessary) we dialed-in, got fully present, stood up for things we believed in, and everything was built upon the reading, beacuse that's where all the thinking started and ended, with something that someone wrote that was worth reading and thinking about. The people shall not perish from One Hundred Years of Solitude. 

One of the purposes of reallyread.it is to create a space for elevated discourse on the internet. Not just civil, elevated. People need to do more than just respect one another. We need to start building ideas together, leaning on each other, probing the deepest recesses of thought. 

As a society, we seem to have developed the hardened perspective that intelligent conversation is too much to ask for, especially online, and extra-especially on open platforms where anyone can participate. 

But it's possible, and it always starts with reading. With slowing down a bit. With becoming, for just a moment, a little less cyborg and a little more human.

Finally, thanks to a fascinating article I discovered on reallyread.it, I started keeping a simple dream journal. It's a riot: weird, fun, scary, and silly in all the ways you'd expect. I highly recommend it. There's a pretty big reward for very small time investment, plus it's a wonderfully relaxing way to spend the first moments of wakefulness in the morning. 

Most important, just keep reading.
