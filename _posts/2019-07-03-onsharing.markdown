What does it mean to share something? 

And why do humans share things with other humans? 

Amongst the Readup crew (meaning: me and Jeff) "share" is now officially a meme, a meta-answer to all the things we can't quite figure out: 

- How are we going to grow? _Share._ 
- When are we going to fundraise? _When we have share._ 
- What's the purpose of the company? _Share._ 

The concept of "share" is just elusive enough to be an appropriate answer to pretty much everything. But like all memes, the thing that makes it funny is also the thing that has a bit of sting. And it hurts because... well... it's true.

We haven't figured out "share." And we need to.

I want to walk you through out thoughts and feelings (and failures) related to share, in hopes that you might be able to help us crack this case and achieve the huge explosive growth we're after. Our ambition is to be something much greater than just a quirky little hub of free-thinking on the web. We want to raise conciousness in a big way. We want everyone, everywhere to be able to have excellent distraction-free reading experiences, _and to be able to distinguish true reading from pseudo-reading activities like scrolling through a feed, skimming headlines, and bouncing around from article to article, task to task.

In the early days of the company, I used to describe Readup (which was then called reallyreadit) as, "a social media platform without liking and sharing." That's only partially true, but more importantly it misses the big point. Here's an attempt to clarify:

Most social media networks, including Facebook and Twitter for example, have "liking" and "sharing" at the very core of their existence. These behaviors power the feed. And the feed, in turn, powers the business model, since that's where the ads appear. Without liking and sharing, everything would come to a grinding halt.

Polling people isn't a good way to figure out what's going on. Aggregate, hairbrained opinions are often misleading and irrelevant, lacking in nuance. Observing _behavior_ on the other hand -- seeing what people _do_ rather than what they _say_ -- can be truly insightful.

So, "Readup doesn't have likes and shares" is actually an understatement. In lieu of all that junk machinery, we have a proven way to determine who's read what, in detail, at scale. Instead of likes, we have _reads_. On Readup, read something is roughly equivalent to giving it a like, a promotion. 

Of course, nobody knows what you've read (because obviously; that would be weird) and the net result is a very _honest_ way to curate articles. 

This is a _profound_ innovation, and something that we think is going to sweep the world. Who cares what people _say_ they're reading. Can you even imagine how transformative it would be if we could all tap into data about what everyone was _actually_ reading? 

That's the goal, and we'll be able to make that happen in the coming years, as long as we can also figure out... you guessed it: share.

One of our several failed attempts at share still currently exists on the site. If you haven't noticed it, you're not alone:

Needless to say, we need to do _a lot_ better than that. And we need to figure it out soon. 

We're not opposed to creating integrations with other social media platforms. In fact, we're eager to do that. (Imagine if you could "mute" non-readers on those platforms?! That'd be a game-changer!) 

What's on your mind right now? This blog post is an attempt to tease apart an extremely tricky product/community/platform problem that doesn't have an easy answer. Hopefully the messiness of my thoughts will encourage you to share some messy thoughts of your own. So let me put this question to you, reader, so that we can figure this monster out together. And for the sake of clarity, I'll rephrase it as clearly as I possibly can: 

**What does Readup need to build to get you sharing some [thing/idea/comment/concept/piece of content] with the rest of the world?** 

**Imagine using Readup for an entire afternoon. Imagine that you are reading and commenting on a handful of powerful articles and stories. And imagine that _part of that experience_ involves roping in some friends and family, or cross-posting to your other platforms. Can you envision that? If so, - and even if it's a little bit murky - please tell us exactly what you're seeing. How are you sharing? What are you sharing? And the biggest question of all: Why?**
