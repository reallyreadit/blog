Dear reader, 
</p>

<p>
First of all: Readup just <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/readup/">launched on Firefox</a> - add the extension now!
</p>

<p>
This is part of a huge update that completely changes the way the Chrome extension works. So, please read this carefully and, as always, get back at us in <a href="https://readup.com/comments/blogreadupcom/huge-changes-to-the-chrome-extension-and-readup-is-available-on-firefox">the comments</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>On Chrome, Readup will no longer track you all over the web. Now you must hit the browser button to turn on the tracker.</strong>
</p>

<p>
The new Readup button works the same way on Chrome and Firefox. When you click it, it does three things at once:
<ul>
<li>It turns on reader-mode.</li>
<li>It turns on the tracking (so you can get credit.)  </li>
<li>And it stars the article (in case you don't finish.)</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Chrome users take note: You will no longer get credit for articles and stories that you read WITHOUT activating Reader-mode. <em>So get in the habit of hitting that button!</em></strong> These changes will propagate to everyone within the next few days. 
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
