We are pleased to announce some major updates to the Leaderboards. In addition to sprucing up the old Leaderboards, we’re introducing two new leadership concepts to the Readup community: Readup Scouts and Readup Scribes.

Here’s what we aim to accomplish with this update: 

<b>(1) Make Readup more interesting and fun.</b>

It’s not possible to make the act of reading any better than it already is. It’s perfect. It’s a solo endeavor, a moment of sacred communion between reader and writer, one that transcends time and space. Reading works. That’s why we’re not messing with it. (In fact, we spend a lot of time trying to “un-mess” what the internet has done to it.) 

But that doesn't mean that there's not a lot that tech can do to increase the quality of <i>community engagement</i> aspect of reading, which in many cases can be as fun and enriching as act of reading itself. 

The idea is to make hanging with readers online as cool as it is to hang with readers in the real world. The leaderboard should feel frivolous, but also useful, inspiring, and practical.

<b>(2) Recognize the leaders of the community.</b>

Communities are as strong as their leaders. The usernames that appear on the Leaderboards are the lifeblood that keeps Readup alive.

<b>(3) Motivate more people to read.</b>

Anything that gets people reading is good. At one point in the company history, we gave away free pizza to cajole people into reading every day. At libraries all around the world, librarians give out treats and prizes and words of encouragement to get children _and adults_ reading. Similarly, we believe in carrots, not sticks. Reading on the internet shouldn't be a carrotless endeavor. On the contrary, it should be abundantly fruitful.

Similarly, Stats feature is a carrot. Designed to reward you for good behavior, by showing you helpful information about your reading habits.

Each carrot, in turn, sometimes feels like a shot in the dark. That's why we want as much of your feedback as possible, all along the way.

Reading, by definition, is a solitary endeavor. Like painting a picture or going scuba diving, it’s basically the opposite of a game. It’s also free. That’s what makes it more like a gift, one that you can give to yourself whenever you want. The cost, however, is your most valuable resource: time. 

The act of reading and the prize of reading are inextricably bound.

When you use Readup, you’re also giving a gift to the rest of the world. And if you appear on the Leaderboards, it means you’re a really spectacular gift-giver. We see the badges as tiny tokens of our genuine gratitude. You <i>are</i> this thing. 

> SCRIBES are the reason that conversations on Readup are better than anywhere else on the internet. If "community conversationalists" wasn't such a mouthful of an expression, we would have called them that. **They earn The Quill.**

> SCOUTS forage the internet for articles and stories that are worthy of the platform. These folks have the key to the conversations on Readup. They mine the incredible raw materials (articles and stories) that get served up on Readup. **They earn the Pair of Binoculars.**
