# Imagine that an alien from outer space is watching a human use Facebook. 

There's a good chance the alien would think that the human is playing a relatively boring video game. The ‘video’ part is interactive and involves a lot of rapid scrolling through information - the News Feed. The ‘game’ is the liking and sharing, the earning of points.

The alien would notice that the game, strangely, has no end. There's no definitive way to win. Players take detours from the game (to buy stuff) but mostly they just skim around, glancing briefly at headlines, liking, sharing, and occasionally commenting. 

Headlines are a *major* part of the game. Reading - real reading - is not. This is because nobody makes money when people *actually* read stuff online. As a result, the average amount of time spent on an article on the internet is about two seconds. 

Clickbait isn't an evil plot. It’s a natural adaptation, a survival response from publishers, an attempt to meet readers *where they are*. Or, in other words, *where they aren’t reading*. 

The alien wonders: What's the point of this game? And how did this game come to engulf the entire journalism industry? 

Twitter, the alien notices, is the same game, a nearly-identical machine but for a few distinguishing characteristics: even shorter nuggets of text, an emphasis on racking up followers, and even more unreality - lots of accounts aren’t even human, they are bots.

The biggest innovation from Facebook isn’t technological, it’s ideological: it’s that *we think the game is real* because it’s populated by all kinds of pseudo-real stuff, updates from people and things you recognize from the real world. 

Everyone plays. Family, friends, strangers and world leaders; liking and sharing, making comments and replies, fighting trolls and echo-chambers, skimming and scanning mindlessly around the web. Doing all kinds of things except reading because that's just not part of the equation. Until now. 

# The solution is reallyread.it

reallyread.it is a social media platform built *for* readers, *by* readers, and *powered by reading*.

We quit our jobs and built it from scratch. [Our story, with pictures.]

reallyread.it is a free speech zone and a safe space of sorts; everyone who participates has to comply with the same widely enforced rule -- you can't leave comments on any articles you haven't fully read. The best part is that “the rule” isn't enforced by people. (No moderators!) Rather, it is enforced by a piece of technology that we have built which is able to identify when a person is or isn’t reading. 

Our technology is simple, but powerful. Using a chrome extension, users get credit for stuff they’ve read fully, which unlocks commenting privileges. It’s not possible to comment on anything you haven’t fully read.

On both sides of the aisle, people feel misunderstood and unable to understand. When anchored in a shared experience, like really reading the same article, for example, people find it easier to see new perspectives and share meaningful, personal insights.
