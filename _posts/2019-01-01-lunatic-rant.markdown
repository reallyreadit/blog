What even *is* social media? 

When Earthlings 'do' social media, what are they actually doing? (Hint: not reading.) 

And what, in turn, is social media doing to us, as individuals and as a society? 

No shortage of “experts” have weighed in on these questions and the world’s largest and most reputable news organizations seem [downright] [obsessed] [with] [the] [topic]. This isn't a huge surprise; these same orgnizations have the most to lose in a world where 'media’ and ‘news’ have come to mean ‘anybody anywhere saying anything.' But the questions remain unanswered. 

Social media : candy :: reading : vegetables.
