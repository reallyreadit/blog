Dear Readers, 
</p>

<p>
Millions of people are trying to use Twitter to figure out what's going on in the world. And millions of them are failing.
<p>  

<p>
It's a problem within a larger problem that Readup is uniquely positioned to solve. So we're going to solve it. And we're going to do it before the 2020 election. 
</p>


<p>
We're going to do this the way we do everything: with 100% of our attention. It's our new <a href="https://readup.com/comments/reforge/growth-loops-are-the-new-funnels/5Q43eD">flywheel</a>. It's our key to securing an ad-free, distraction-free future for readers everywhere.
</p>

<p>
We need growth. Twitter needs reading, focus, and slowing down. It's a match made in heaven. Maybe. Either way, it's going to be an interesting few weeks. 
</p>

<p>
In the next few days, we're going to make the Twitter integration available to a small number of beta testers. In exchange for early access, we'll ask for your candid feedback. You won't have to change your internet behaviors at all, but hopefully you'll enjoy the web, and especially Twitter, a lot more.
</p>

<h3>
To participate in the Twitter beta, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/oUJwMWFd34Wez3Pc8">this form</a> by Monday at noon PST. 
</h3>

<p>
The roller-coaster continues, 
</p>
