Last week, I published [The Readup Manifesto](https://blog.readup.com/2021/02/08/the-readup-manifesto.html), which kicked off some [really interesting conversation](https://readup.com/comments/blogreadupcom/the-readup-manifesto) about growth. 

There was one paragraph, in particular, that stirred up a lot of energy: 

> Readup is the right size. It’s the size it’s meant to be. Growth will be a result of our success, but growth itself is not the goal. Wherever we are is where we’re meant to be and however big we are is how big we’re meant to be. This is more than a zen mantra; it’s the closest thing to a “corporate strategy” that we’ve got.

Some people loved it. Some people didn't. I love when that happens. If we all always agreed on everything, nothing new would ever happen. We would never change. We would never grow. 

On the contrary, the emergence of conflict signals an opportunity to do real, hard work. To *figure stuff out*. As the CEO of Readup, I see it as my job to shine a bright light on the messy, challenging stuff. 

Thus, my goal for this essay is to make a concrete "statement" about growth -- how we think about it, why we think about it, and what it does and doesn't mean to us. (As always, I hope that in exchange for my candor you'll consider sharing your thoughts.)

To get started, I'll try to summarize the two positions that emerged in response to that paragraph. One particular sentence in [Pegeen's comment](https://readup.com/comments/blogreadupcom/the-readup-manifesto/DJMlAz) summarizes the first perspective: 

> What I fear most is that Readup will not survive due to lack of growth.

Wow. Fear is a really powerful word. And I can relate, on a deep, visceral level with the fear that Pegeen describes. In fact, I feel that fear daily. Sometimes I find myself trying to hide that fear from my co-founder, [Jeff](https://readup.com/@jeff). I try to hide that fear from my family on our weekly Zoom calls. And above all else, I try to hide that fear from myself. 

I also try to remind myself that it's a *healthy* fear. We can *do something* with it. And I'm thankful for this opportunity to stare that fear in the face. Publicly. Because that always feels good. 

On the other side of this debate there is an entirely different fear. [danielw](https://readup.com/comments/blogreadupcom/the-readup-manifesto/DdZEQV) used the term "worry" to describe how he feels: 

> I worry what happens when the community gets larger.

Alas! This is *also* something that I can relate to on a visceral level. Many of us are really enjoying Readup exactly as it is, and sometimes I feel like one of those moms who can't handle the fact that her child will not remain a child forever. 

In an email to me, [jayvidya](https://readup.com/@jayvidya) clarified this feeling by invoking "super duper love" instead of fear. He wrote: 

> I read the new manifesto last time i was on readup and super duper loved it.  Really loved the part about it being 'just the right size'. An important philosophy in this age of aggressive growth.

So, after all was said and done (meaning, written and discussed) here's where things netted out: 

Growth is a challenge and a problem. It is also extremely important if we are going to survive.

Here's what I think: It is inevitable that Readup will grow. It is part of our dharma. It's what we've been working on, day in and day out for the last half decade. It's what we're here to do. It's why I'm sitting here writing this blog post, and, to an extent, it's why you're reading it. So we all need to get ready for it. Because it's coming. The wheels are already in motion.

But wait. I just invoked 'dharma' which means I need to come back down to Earth. Here's an anchor: *Readers want and expect Readup to grow.* That might seem obvious, but I needed to go back through hundreds of emails and comments in order to wrap my head around that simple fact. It's actually shocking the see the number of times that people have said to me things like, "I hope this gets huge!" and "Everyone should use Readup!" It happens so often that I think I stopped hearing it. (That's why exercises like this are so helpful. They're an opportunity to look at old, obvious stuff with fresh eyes.) 

Thus, it seems like everyone already knows that Readup *will* grow and *needs to* grow. But that doesn't mean that there aren't still some growth-related itches that need scratching. So, let's pry into two very complicated questions that still haven't yet been answered: *Why?* and *How?* 

*Why* do we want to grow? 

And *how* are we going to do it?

The first question is the bigger, tougher one. It's also the one that most startup tech companies completely ignore. The reason they ignore it is because they don't like the answer: They grow in order to make money. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with this. The vast majority of people do work *just* to make money. I've done it many times in the past in the past. It's a good arrangement. Easy, simple and honest.

The problem is when people pretend like they're working for a mission or purpose (or any "higher calling") but they're actually just working for money. This self-delusion is so common in Silicon Valley that we might refer to it as "the ethos of startup life."

I don't think that people in Silicon Valley spend much time thinking about what the internet is doing to us, -- our brains, relationships, society -- even though they *talk* about it a lot. And I think the reason for that is because they're so busy doing their jobs -- making money. In a way, everything "works" because employees have the same "purpose" as their employers -- again, making money. I have a lot of friends who work at Google, Facebook, etc, and they're always saying things like, "It pays the bills," or "I enjoy the challenges," or "My team is great," or whatever.

That's all good, but Readup is different. Impact is our number one priority. We are in a unique position to completely transform the social media industry, drop a nuke on ads, and provide a much-needed *new* revenue stream for Writers. Money is the key to everything. 

Yesterday, on a whim, I signed up for [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/), Silicon Valley's hottest, buzziest new social startup. Actually it was hot and buzzy a year ago, but I'm late to everything, so I just got in there yesterday.

I was expecting to be bored and disappointed, but I actually found Clubhouse to be... well... fun. It's like having an audio-only zoom with total strangers. Uniquely, not everybody can talk. Moderators decide who gets the "microphone." Newcomers have to "raise their hand" and be called upon to speak. Bad actors can be silenced immediately, so people can express themselves more freely. 

Like Readup, Clubhouse aims to take some marketshare from the monoliths (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) with a simple value proposition: *This isn't a place where anybody can do or say anything. We have rules and norms.* It's not a free-for-all, which makes it feel more humane.

But that's where the comparison ends. In every other way, Readup and Clubhouse are opposites. Clubhouse is heavy on hype and light on substance while Readup is heavy on substance and completely hype-less. (If you know how to hype, please hit me up.) Ultimately, decentralization of the social web will be good for everybody, so I guess I'm rooting for Clubhouse. The world needs thousands of Clubhouses and thousands of Readups. We'll get there, but it will take some time. 

Readup has 3,760 Readers. Clubhouse has six million users. But still, I prefer our position. 

Clubhouse has a billion dollar valuation and no business model. And no revenue. This is the Silicon Valley way: Use borrowed money to get giant -- *really* giant -- and then, at some point, scramble to cash out. It's an approach that's missing something that I think really matters: intention. 

The investors and co-founders of Clubhouse would probably think that Readup is so small that we basically don't exist. They're wrong. The fact that Readup has so many passionate Readers *without scale* is actually a testament to the incredible experience that we're providing to our community.

Plus, we have a purpose.

My experience on Clubhouse made some things very clear to me. For one thing, Clubhouse exists for one reason and one reason only: to make money. No sane person can suggest that "a twist on audio chat rooms" has the power to improve the world. But still we're asked to nod along with the quasi-religious belief that all disruption is good. Whatever. That conversation bores me. The conversation that doesn't bore me (and doesn't bore the existing Readup community) involves reading, getting smarter, and making really good use of your online time.   

For Clubhouse to be successful, they need viral growth. They need to get people hooked to these little  audio rooms which may or may not be a productive way to spend time. 

Reading, on the other hand, is *always* a productive way to spend time. It requires time and effort. Real work. 

We don't want viral growth, and we don't even think it makes sense to aim for that. Viruses are bad. They grow the same way that cancer grows: by killing other stuff. This kind of growth is out of control. 

We want to grow like a tree. Trees grow in a really beautiful, coordinated (yet random) way. They enhance the ecosystems that surround them, providing nutrients to the soil and habitat for animals. When trees grow, they make life better.

Soon, we're going to introduce our ultimate innovation: a brand new revenue stream for writers. It has taken way longer than we expected it to, but it's coming. When we launch our Subscriptions product, it's going to create a lot of growth really fast. Here's how: 

It's important to understand that this isn't a "zero-sum" victory; We're not "taking" revenue from somewhere else. That's what makes this a *true* innovation. We're doing something that's never been done before: We're going to ask readers to pay to read *free stuff*. But it will be worth it because (1) the reading experience on Readup is infinitely better than reading anywhere else and (2) you are *directly* supporting the writers you read.

And here's what's so awesome: As Readup grows, that revenue stream will grow with us. And the revenue stream will go straight into the pockets of writers, so they're going to want to grow it even more. That's our growth hypothesis: Writers will be motivated to get people reading on Readup. 

As a result of our growth, all of the following will happen: 
- More people will spend more time in the flow of "deep reading."
- People will see fewer ads and experience fewer distractions. 
- Chaos, globally, will subside. 

That last bulletpoint isn't meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but it's okay if you take it with a grain of salt. Just remember: If you believe that reading makes you a better, happier, healthier person (and almost nobody argues with that) than how can you *not* believe that more people reading is good for everything and everyone. 

Reading makes me feel sane. Therefore, if everyone reads more, maybe we'll all just feel a little more sane. 

Yesterday, I stood with my friend at the edge of a large, snow-covered field. On the other side of the field were some giant cottonwood trees with a seemingly-infinite number of fractal branches that reached up to the sky. 

Unprompted, my friend said, "Neurons in the brain look exactly like trees. How crazy is that?"

*Really crazy,* I thought. 

I also thought: *Readup helps people grow those little neuronal trees in their brains.* And how crazy is that?!
