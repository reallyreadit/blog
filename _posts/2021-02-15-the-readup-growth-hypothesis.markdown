Last week, I published [The Readup Manifesto](https://blog.readup.com/2021/02/08/the-readup-manifesto.html), which kicked off some [really interesting conversation](https://readup.com/comments/blogreadupcom/the-readup-manifesto) about growth. 

There was one paragraph, in particular, that stirred up a lot of energy: 

> Readup is the right size. It’s the size it’s meant to be. Growth will be a result of our success, but growth itself is not the goal. Wherever we are is where we’re meant to be and however big we are is how big we’re meant to be. This is more than a zen mantra; it’s the closest thing to a “corporate strategy” that we’ve got.

Some people loved it. Some people didn't. I love when that happens. If we all always agreed on everything, nothing new would ever happen. We would never change. We would never grow. 

On the contrary, the emergence of conflict signals an opportunity to do real, hard work. To f*igure stuff out*. As the CEO of Readup, I see it as my job to shine a bright light on the messy, challenging stuff. 

Thus, my goal for this essay is to make a concrete "statement" about growth -- how we think about it, why we think about it, and what it does and doesn't mean to us. (As always, I hope that in exchange for my candor you'll consider sharing your thoughts.)

To get started, I'll try to summarize the two positions that emerged in response to that paragraph. One particular sentence in [Pegeen's comment](https://readup.com/comments/blogreadupcom/the-readup-manifesto/DJMlAz) summarizes the first perspective: 

> What I fear most is that Readup will not survive due to lack of growth.

Wow. Fear is a really powerful word. And I can relate, on a deep, visceral level with the fear that Pegeen describes. In fact, I feel that fear daily. Sometimes I find myself trying to hide that fear from my co-founder, [Jeff](https://readup.com/@jeff). I try to hide that fear from my family on our weekly Zoom calls. And above all else, I try to hide that fear from myself. 

I also try to remind myself that it's a *healthy* fear. We can *do something* with it. And I'm thankful for this opportunity to stare that fear in the face. Publicly. Because that always feels good. 

On the other side of this debate there is an entirely different fear. [danielw](https://readup.com/comments/blogreadupcom/the-readup-manifesto/DdZEQV) used the term "worry" to describe how he feels: 

> I worry what happens when the community gets larger.

Alas! This is *also* something that I can relate to on a visceral level. It's impossible for me to deny that I absoultely love Readup just the way it is. In a way, I don't want it to grow up. I want it to stay like this forever -- both intimate and open, free and safe. I'm like one of those moms who can't handle the fact that her child will not remain a child forever. 

In an email to me, [jayvidya](https://readup.com/@jayvidya) clarified this feeling by invoking "super duper love" instead of fear. He wrote: 

> I read the new manifesto last time i was on readup and super duper loved it.  Really loved the part about it being 'just the right size'. An important philosophy in this age of aggressive growth.

So, after all was said and done (meaning, written and discussed) here's where things netted out: 

Growth is a challenge and a problem. It is also extremely important if we are going to survive.

Here's what I think: 

Like a healthy-looking little sprout, it is inevitable that Readup will grow. It is part of our dharma. It's what we've been working on, day in and day out for the last half decade. It's what we're here to do. It's why I'm sitting here writing this blog post, and, to an extent, it's why you're reading it. So we all need to get ready for it. Because it's coming. The wheels are already in motion.

But wait. I just invoked 'dharma' which means I need to come back down to Earth. Here's an anchor: *Readers want and expect Readup to grow.* That might seem obvious, but I needed to go back through hundreds of emails and comments in order to wrap my head around that simple fact. It's actually shocking the see the number of times that people have said to me things like, "I hope this gets huge!" and "Everyone should use Readup!" It happens so often that I think I stopped hearing it. (That's why exercises like this are so helpful. They're an opportunity to look at old, obvious stuff with fresh eyes.) 

Thus, it seems like everyone already knows that Readup *will* grow and *needs to* grow. But that doesn't mean that there aren't still some growth-related itches that need scratching. To make things messy again, let's pry into two very complicated questions that still haven't yet been answered: *Why?* and *How?* 

*Why* do we want to grow? 

And *how* are we going to do it?

The first question is the bigger, tougher one. It's also the one that most startup tech companies completely ignore. The reason they ignore it is because they don't like the answer: They grow in order to make money. 

I want to be very careful to clarify that I don't think there's anything wrong with this. The vast majority of people do work to make money. I have worked a lot of blue-collar jobs in my life and have always had very strongly positive feelings about that arrangement, working *just* to make money. It's easy and simple. And thus it feels very honest.

The problem is when people pretend like they're working for a mission or purpose (or any "higher calling") but they're actually just working for money. This self-delusion is so common in Silicon Valley that we might refer to it as "the ethos of startup life."

I don't think that people in Silicon Valley spend much time thinking about what the internet is doing to us, to our brains, our relationships, our society, even though they *talk* about it a lot. And I think the reason for that is because they are so busy doing their jobs. The job is making money. And the organizations are built to make money. In a weird way, everything "works" because employees have the same "purpose" as their employers. But also, everything is so broken because all of these people are lying to themselves and each other.

I have a lot of friends who work at Google, Facebook, etc, and they're always saying things like, "It pays the bills," or "I enjoy the challenges," or "My team is great," or whatever. So maybe the problem isn't as bad as I'm making it out to be. Maybe everyone knows what's happening. But I think that we're still in the process of waking up to this strange new reality. After all, just a few years ago almost everyone entertained the fantasy that Facebook, for example, was doing something good for the world.

As a result, Readup is sailing against some nasty headwinds. To illustrate my point, ask yourself how this statement makes you feel: 

> The co-founders of Readup aren't trying to get rich. They're trying to improve the internet. 

Admit it: You feel skepticism, doubt and maybe even confusion. Right? You should! It's not "normal" to be so passionate about a cause that you put it *before* financial success, especially when your "cause" is a business. This "purpose-first" mindset, by the way, seems to be way more common (but still quite rare) amongst artists, creatives, and spiritual-seekers. It's impossible to deny that it exists, but it's also impossible not to be wary of these people. If we're all chasing money, we're all on the same page. But we're not and we aren't. And Readup is one of those very special companies that is actually different. 

Yesterday, on a whim, I signed up for [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/), Silicon Valley's hottest, buzziest new social startup. Actually it was hot and buzzy a year ago, but I'm late to everything, so I just got in there yesterday. You can't even join if you don't have an invite, which seems to me like a really good way to *prevent* diversity on the platform, but that's neither here nor there. 

I was expecting to be bored and disappointed, but I actually found Clubhouse to be... well... fun! It's like having an audio-only zoom with total strangers who share your interest in a particular topic. And, uniquely, not everybody can talk. Moderators decide who gets the "microphone." Newcomers have to "raise their hand" and be called upon to speak. Bad actors can be silenced immediately, which means, in theory, that speakers are more free to express themselves more freely. 

And I think it really works! One of my first thoughts was: Wow, this is surprisingly *humane*. It's not an absolute free-for-all. 

At one point, somebody made a great point and I wanted to applaud, but there was no way to do so. So I just sat there and kept listening. How normal. How nice. 

Like Readup, Clubhouse aims to take some marketshare from the monoliths (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) with a simple value proposition: *This isn't a place where anybody can do or say anything. We have rules and norms.*

But that's where the comparison ends. In every other way, Readup and Clubhouse are opposites. Clubhouse is heavy on spin and light on substance while Readup is heavy on substance and light on spin. 

But I'm still rooting for them. Decentralization of the social web will be good for everybody; the world needs thousands of Clubhouses and thousands of Readups.

Clubhouse has a billion dollar valuation and no business model. And no revenue. This is the Silicon Valley way: Use borrowed money and hype to get giant -- *Really* giant -- and then, at some point, scramble to cash out. It's an approach that's missing something that I really care about: intention. 

Readup has 3,760 Readers. The investors and co-founders of Clubhouse would probably think that Readup is so small that we basically don't exist. They're wrong. But still, it's easy for me to forget that. When I started using Clubhouse, it made me feel like Readup was, frankly, embarrassingly small. And that made me feel like my life was small. (This malaise has an easy fix: Reading on Readup. The only way to believe that Readup is inconsequential is if you believe that deep reading is inconsequential. It isn't.)

Overall, my experience on Clubhouse made some things very clear to me. For one thing, Clubhouse exists for one reason and one reason only: to make money. No sane person can suggest that "a twist on audio chat rooms" has the power to improve the world. But still we're asked to nod along with the quasi-religious belief that all disruption is good. It isn't. 

For Clubhouse to be successful, they need scalable, exponential, astronomical growth. They need to grow the way that all Silicon Valley tech startups need to grow: They need to go viral.

This is the kind of growth that Readup *doesn't* want. Viruses are bad. They grow the same way that cancer grows: by killing other stuff. This kind of growth is out of control. It make people feel out of control. And it spins society out of control. 

This is why Silicon Valley needs a new growth metaphor. Conveniently, Readup has one. 

We want to grow like a tree. Slow and steady. Trees grow in a really beautiful, coordinated (yet random) way. They enhance the ecosystems that surround them, providing nutrients to the soil and habitat for animals. When trees grow, they make life better.

So that's *why* we want to grow. But it's not *how*. Here's how: 

Soon, we're going to introduce our ultimate innovation: a brand new revenue stream for writers. (By the way, I need to quickly fall on a sword. At the end of last summer, I told you that this was going to take a few weeks. I was dead wrong. Converting Readup from a free to paid platform is significnatly more work than we could have imagined, but that's okay. We're still moving forward. That's what matters.)

When we launch our Subscriptions product, it's going to create a lot of growth really fast. That's what happens with trees too. The season needs to be right. You can't make a tree grow in winter. And you can't prevent it from growing in the spring and summer. 

It's important to understand that this isn't a "zero-sum" victory; We're not "taking" revenue from somewhere else. That's what makes this a *true* innovation. We're doing something that's never been done before: We're going to ask readers to pay to read *free stuff*. But it will be worth it because (1) the reading experience on Readup is infinitely better than reading anywhere else and (2) you are *directly* supporting the writers you read.

And here's what's so awesome: As Readup grows, that revenue stream will grow with us. And the revenue stream will go straight into the pockets of writers, so they're going to want to grow it even more. That's our growth hypothesis: Writers will be motivated to get people reading on Readup. 

As a result of our growth, all of the following will happen: 
- More people will spend more time in the flow of "deep reading."
- People will see fewer ads and experience fewer distractions. 
- Chaos, globally, will subside. 

That last bulletpoint isn't meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but it's okay if you take it with a grain of salt. Just remember: If you believe that reading makes you a better, happier, healthier person (and almost nobody argues with that) than how can you *not* believe that more people reading is good for everything and everyone. 

Reading makes me feel sane. Therefore, if everyone reads more, maybe we'll all just feel a little more sane. 

Yesterday, I stood with my friend at the edge of a large, snow-covered field. On the other side of the field were some giant cottonwood trees with a seemingly-infinite number of fractal branches that reached up to the sky. 

Unprompted, my friend said, "Neurons in the brain look exactly like trees. How crazy is that?"

*Really crazy,* I thought. 

I also thought: *Readup helps people grow those little neuronal trees in their brains.* And how crazy is that?!
