<p> Dear Reader, </p> <p> I spent most of last night meditating on this: </p> <p> <img src="/pics/darfeb.png" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:100%;"> </p> <p> It's a hockey stick. No doubt about it. And since this growth is actually a few weeks early, we're expecting to see a vertical wall within a month. We don’t just want a "spark" or a "pop." We want this thing to <em>fucking explode</em>.* </p> <p> The presidential election is right around the corner. In more ways than one, all eyes are on social media. Our goal is to move millions of eyes <em>away from the noise</em> and over to something better: <strong>reading</strong>. </p> <div style="width:75%;margin:1.5em auto;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;"></div> <p> Stuff that happened this week: </p>

        <li>Readup is on <a href="https://twitter.com/ReadupDotCom/status/1225886334675406848">Twitter</a>.</li> 
        <li>Two Y Combinator partners <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP32_y4JZDQ&feature=youtu.be&t=4007">critiqued</a> the Readup site design. </li>
        <li>Jeff and I did a <a href="https://twitter.com/ProductHuntPod/status/1225095923887329280?s=20">podcast</a>! Thanks to Product Hunt and Abadesi Osunsade for hosting us!</li> 
        <li>Our friend Jay Vidyarthi <a href="https://readup.com/read/attention-activist/10-cautiously-optimistic-technologies--attention-activist">wrote</a> about Readup. Here's my favorite part: <strong><em>"I’ll admit, the first time I saw a ReadUp post described as a “29 min read”, I was totally scared off. But after I came back and actually read it, it dawned on me: this app solves a real problem."</em></strong></li>
    </ul>

<p> Onward! </p> <p> -Bill </p> <p> *P.S. Thanks to the AOTD, I'm stoked on <em><a href="https://readup.com/read/the-toast/a-linguist-explains-the-syntax-of-fuck---the-toast">fucking</a></em> right now. </p>
