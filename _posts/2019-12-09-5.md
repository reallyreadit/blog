<p> Dear reader, </p> <p> Greetings from Joshua Tree, California, where the two-person team behind Readup is in the throes of a company-wide retreat. After feasting with my co-founder's family, we're now at my brother's place in the desert. Things are getting dialed-in. Things are happening. </p> <div style="width:75%;margin:1.5em auto;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;"></div> <h2> Product Updates </h2> <p> To get the most out of Readup, it’s important to know how to send articles to Readup from anywhere on the internet. Here’s a demo to show you how long-tapping works on iOS: </p> <p> <img src="http://blog.readup.com/pics/share-extension-long-tap-text.gif" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:100%;"> </p> <p> Whenever you see an article that you want to read on Readup, just follow these steps: </p> <ul> <li> Long-tap the link. </li> <li> Hit “Share” </li> <li> Hit the Readup icon </li> </ul> </p> <p> That’s it! Then you’ll see the article on your starred list on Readup and you can read it whenever you want. </p> <div style="width:75%;margin:1.5em auto;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;"></div> <h2> The Numbers </h2> <p> At this point, we have a long enough view to assess the overall impact of several major changes that we recently made to the platform. Here’s how things are looking: </p> <p> <img src="https://blog.readup.com/pics/readsnov.png" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:100%;"> </p> <p> iOS app engagement definitely went up after we launched the new notification system (indicated by the green arrow) but then it appears to plateau. I can’t explain the Chrome spikes (any ideas?!) but overall everything still feels… stuck. So, we’re feeling mostly “meh” about this. </p> <p> The situation with comments is a slightly rosier picture: </p> <p> <img src="https://blog.readup.com/pics/commentsnov.png" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:100%;"> </p> <p> The AOTDs are doing what they should be doing - encouraging conversation. Notifications (green arrow) worked, for sure. And although November is up from October by a noticeable margin, we’re still nowhere near resting on our laurels. </p> <div style="width:75%;margin:1.5em auto;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;"></div> <h2> The Big Picture </h2> <p> Change is everywhere, but the long view remains constant. We’re always flying by the seat of our pants, and always one step away from the key to sustainable growth. </p> <p> Making the internet better is hard, <i>real</i> work. If it was any easier, someone would have done it already. But readers deserve better. And <em>everyone</em> deserves better. So here we gogogo! </p> <p> With gratitude, </p> <p> Bill </p>
