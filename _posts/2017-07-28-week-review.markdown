<b>Ups</b>
- 33 comments this past week. 
- Getting new comments every day now.
- Some comments are really long and interesting.
- Coming soon: Stars! To help you make better reading choices and read better stuff.  

<b>Downs</b>
- We're not ready, yet, to scale. If ten thousand people download our extension overnight, our servers would fail. Jeff can fix, but needs time to implement.
- We need faster growth, soon. Bill working on that.
