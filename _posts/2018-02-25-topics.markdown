**Talk to other people who are really reading the same things you're really reading.**

It's a great - and strange! - time to be building a social media platform. 

'Great' because basically everyone everywhere now knows that Facebook, Twitter and Reddit are junk.

But also 'strange' because user experiences, across the board, are so outrageously low. The concept of *constructive* conversation sounds impossibly idealistic. Wasting countless hours wading through an endless stream of bad content, on our feeds and in our inboxes, seems like an unavoidable reality that we should just get used to. But we shouldnt...

**We're kicking off an experiment. Tell us what you want to learn about and we'll send you a single link per week to an epic article on that topic.**

The same technology that we use to identify clickbait can be used to identify clickbait's opposite: worthy, thoughtful, longer reads. In other words, stuff that real people are really reading. 

And, combined with article metadata (nuggets of info like 'Trump,' 'climate change' and 'scifi') we're now able to find the absolute best articles on virtually any topic.

In case skimmed that part, I'll say it again:

"We're now able to find the absolute best articles on virtually any topic."

So, we're launching (yet another) email-based beta program and we want you to join.

**HOW TO PARTICIPATE:**

1.) Email bill@reallyread.it and tell me what 1-2 topic(s) you care most about. (Examples: yoga & cryptocurrency) <br><br>
2.) On Mondays, I'll email you back with link(s) to the world's best articles on those topics. <br><br>
3.) In exchange for this wonderful service I'm providing, I hope you'll consider leaving comments on some articles. And... <br><br> 
4.) If you want articles on different topics (or to opt out entirely) just let me know and I'll save you the spam.

Imagine if you really read 1-2 beefy articles per week on [insert your favorite: climate change, gun control, ed-tech, etc.] every single week. How smart you'd be!
