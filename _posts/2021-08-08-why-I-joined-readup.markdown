Hello readers! My name is Thor, now officially the third employee at Readup. Together with Bill and Jeff, I'm working daily to build and grow the world's best reading app. 

Like many readers, I often leave crumbs of my identity in my Readup posts: you may have found that I'm a Belgian living in the European north, a (humane) tech aficionado, elaborate comment writer, and generally interested in an ever-increasing variety of articles. That last interest wasn't always there: it's something that Readup evoked in me.

I also happen to like running (mostly 1 miles), cycling (the commuting kind, and the week-long touring kind), sauna (very hot & Finnish), and the occasional beer (every other one non-alcoholic). But that's not what I'm here to write about. In what follows I want to tell you how I joined Readup, why I did so, and why I believe the world needs Readup. Because it truly does. 

Readup is technology that respects and enriches humans. To Readup, I personally owe the pleasure of online reading. And as I am joining this company, Readup is on a path to a wild and bright future that I invite you to join.

## My Readup Story: Humane Tech

My Readup story began before Readup. I'd been a techie throughout my teenage years, so starting a career in software development & design followed naturally. In Computer Science grad school however, I became disillusioned with the tech world outside my coursework. What was I working towards?

Facebook, Instagram and others had morphed from being an exciting new place of connection into largely time-draining pools of meaninglessness, capitalizing on attention without much afterthought. I realized that gazing daily at the lunch of an acquaintance vacationing halfway around the globe was not the most valuable use of my time, and yet, tech's rising giants kept finding ways to fish for more of my engagement and more of my attention.

I was not alone in this feeling. Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin founded the Time Well Spent movement (now the CHT, [Center for Humane Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Humane_Technology)), and by religiously following their activities, podcasts and [attending conference talks](https://thorgalle.me/articles/7-cool-things-at-slush-2018), I learned more about the global issues exacerbated by the attention economy: social injustice, loneliness, and more recently; misinformation.

The Center brought a hopeful message. With [exciting design ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbowwoeYCro&t=25s) and [inspirational essays](https://readup.com/comments/nxhxorg/choicemaking-and-the-interface), they envisioned a more humane internet. One that tipped the scale to adding value to lives with tech, rather than extracting value from them for advertisers. I got excited too; because I wanted to contribute my growing technology skills to make this dream a reality. 

I devoured everything new in the space; I installed the attention-saving community tools Siempo on my Android phone, and [Nudge](https://nudgeware.io/) in my browser. I personally aimed to create meaningful digital products and services for people. My first career step in a gap year before starting my master's was to contribute to a social app for care homes in Belgium in 2017, now [soulcenter.be](http://soulcenter.be).

But life went on. I got my master's degree, and a real humane tech revolution stayed out. Today, despite their merits, Facebook; Google and Twitter still primarily try to make you watch as many ads as possible. And there are still no alternatives at scale that fully respect human limits and intentions. 

The CHT did an increasingly good job in popularizing the problems of today's attention economy, for example, it released *The Social Dilemma* documentary on Netflix in 2020, but it has achieved very little in making the internet actually more humane. Because that's the hardest part! Even the venerated writer Harari pointed it out as critical lesson for the 21 century: big tech's business models need to change for them to escape this vicious circle. With grassroots humane tech tools struggling for traction, the movement was in a dire spot however. 

Then Readup came along. I made an account in 2019, following a reference in the Humane Tech Community forums. Readup wasn't yet the business it is today, but it already was a special corner of the internet: a social reading community that cared deeply about the value of focused reading, supported by tech that aimed to genuinely improve reader's lives.

I started using Readup for its minimalist reader mode. It made online reading a relaxing and rewarding activity. I stayed on, because I quickly noticed that the articles shared on Readup were of top-notch quality. I experienced the welcoming and thoughtful community of engaged readers, who I started knowing by their reader names. Readup was motivating me to finish good articles, without pushing me to read more than I wanted. This stuff was humane tech! And that is where our long-term relationship began.

## Discovering Reading

I wasn't really a reader before Readup. Since the end of 2019, Readup added this vital new hobby to my days.

I've always been a casual reader of books. But when it came to texts of shorter form, news sites or articles; I'd only really read something when actively researching a topic, getting articles linked through a social platform, or when my dad left a magazine on the kitchen table. Throughout most of 2019, I maybe read about five articles per month. If I read them at all.

Enter Readup. Readup's community recommendations consistently piqued my interest and my activity reading followed suit. Since I joined, I've been enjoying at least twenty insightful pieces monthly, often long-form pieces of over 20 minutes, by just being on Readup.

I've come to appreciate the activity of online deep reading thoroughly. It satisfies my curiosity with its diversity, it helps me gain knowledge, it inspires and moves me. And importantly, it feels like a refuge from the flickering, two-second-a-piece attention timespan of social media feeds. While I don't think they are all evil, they exhaust me easily. 

Reading on Readup instead is invariably Time Well Spent. I'm laughing with absurd stories like ["The Boyfriend Identity"](https://readup.com/read/the-new-yorker/the-boyfriend-identity-part-1), and I'm getting educated on topics as diverse as [African American Vernacular English](https://readup.com/comments/the-babbel-magazine/the-united-states-of-accents-african-american-vernacular-english/VXvnLD) and the [psychology of money](https://readup.com/comments/collaborative-fund/the-psychology-of-money).

Early during the pandemic, I've gotten the chance to reflect on the infamous [Swedish approach and what influenced it culturally](https://readup.com/comments/unherd/what-we-can-learn-from-the-swedish-paradox---unherd). I also got a deeper background understanding of the history of flu epidemics through [The Dead Zone](https://readup.com/comments/the-new-yorker/the-dead-zone) by Malcom Gladwell published in 1997, the [political disaster in India](https://readup.com/comments/the-guardian/arundhati-roy-on-indias-covid-catastrophe-we-are-witnessing-a-crime-against-huma) and [recent mRNA vaccine breakthroughs](https://readup.com/comments/wired-uk/the-mrna-vaccine-revolution-is-just-beginning/DGd315).

Through the Readup community, I'm getting prickled by considerate debates about topics such as [drug use and abuse](https://readup.com/comments/nautilus/i-am-a-heroin-user-i-do-not-have-a-drug-problem), [gender](https://readup.com/comments/jk-rowling/jk-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues---/VXvp7D), and [eating meat](https://readup.com/comments/-the-new-york-times-company/the-coronavirus-and-a-world-without-meat). These debates are considerate, because all participants are certified to have read the article that sparked the conversation. A breath of fresh air from the inflamed commentary that abounds on platforms like Twitter, YouTube and Reddit.

Through Readup's Article of the Day recommendations, I got sensitized by stories about [poverty](https://readup.com/comments/zora/the-poor-cant-afford-not-to-wear-nice-clothes), the difficulties of [raising a child with disabilities](https://readup.com/comments/longreads/out-there-i-have-to-smile), biases and [discrimination](https://readup.com/comments/the-atlantic/racism-is-terrible-blackness-is-not). These stories had an effect in my daily life and how I view the world, and I have to thank them for that.

The source of the article hasn't mattered much. Readup made me discover great writing in established publications like *The New Yorker* and *The Atlantic*; but also articles from countless independent writers like Tim Urban (from Wait But Why), Medium and self-published Wordpress bloggers.

Readup helps to navigate this enormity of writing. It's like a Spotify for reading: you can consume what you like already, get inspired by what friends are consuming, or let the algorithm guide you to new places.

Reading articles and short stories might not be for everyone, but I've come love it sustainably. It now coexists in my life with reading books, listening to podcasts and watching films and series, an essential part of my information diet. 

And it would be amazing if it could be a part more people's diets. I believe that so many people with an overexposure to Twitter would do well with a calm, digital reading environment that invites them to consume great content. An environment that is strangely absent today.

So many online publications confirm it to me: reading on the internet is horribly broken.

Which writer can truthfully say: "Yes please! Add some flashy advertisements next to my article and in between my paragraphs! And while you're at it, pop up a video or two as well." Which publisher of serious articles can be proud of having to promote polarizing clickbait titles to get more ad views, shoving thirty tracking cookies onto site visitors? And which reader rationally thinks that ad-blocking is an economically healthy way to consume articles on internet?

{% include image.html url="/assets/2021/08/ken.screen.png" description="An award-winning article on an all-too-common looking site. Practically unreadable!" %}

None of this sounds great. And yet, it is the state of reading on the internet today. As with social media, the problem of the article industry is inextricably linked with a deadlocked business model. Readers expect easy, complete and cheap access to an overly-fragmented world of online writing. Writers want to get paid. And no one connects them directly. Readup can, because Readup changes the business model.

## Advancing Readup

Like every business, Readup is a continuous work-in-progress. It is complex and incomplete, but at its core, it is already a beautifully functional and wildly ambitious. Working together with Bill, Jeff and future colleagues, I aim to grow Readup into the global home for online reading that is destined to be. Deliberately, and one piece at at time.

Next up we're launching a crucially simplified user experience. In a matter of days, a Windows desktop app goes live next to our existing Mac app, and Android phone support will follow soon after. No functionality changes, but the essence of Readup is now put upfront: Readup is the world's best cross-platform reading app. It's a separate environment where you can do your reading in peace, and in good company. Browsers still help you find articles, but reading happens on Readup at your own convenience.

Down the line, there are plenty of shortcomings and scores of features that we will work our way through while staying true to our core value: caring for the reader. We aim to make Readup better at every step, course-correcting missteps when necessary. To do we will require constant listening to the reading community. So, don't hesitate to reach out to us at support@readup.com or to me personally at thor@readup.com whenever you have ideas, comments or thoughts.

The writing is on the wall. Readers and potential readers need Readup to reconnect with deep reading of inspiring and challenging thoughts. Independent writers need Readup to build a sustainable income, automatically. The journalism industry needs Readup to absolve itself from a dwindling traditional reading market and sketchy clickbait. A good friend said in a call recently, *Readup is on the right side of history*. And I'm absolutely thrilled and honoured I can contribute to shape that history!
