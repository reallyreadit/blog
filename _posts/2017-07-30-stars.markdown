Today we're launching a new cool feature. You can now "star" any articles or stories that you might want to read or comment on at a later time.

Really reading is hard. It requires two meaningful investments - time and attention. Trying to read a 45-minute article in five minutes is weak. (So is trying to tweet about it.)

Stars are for anything that's too long for right now, but worth a revisit later. They might also be the ones clogging up your browser tabs right now. 

Go star some stuff and let us know what you think.

We built stars because the community asked for it. Got an idea for a new feature or functionality? Email bill@reallyread.it
